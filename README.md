## Common Programming Concepts
### Variables:
- Variables are immutable by default. Can be made mutable by writing mut keyword before variable name.
- Constants are declared using const keyword. For every const declaration data type must be specified.
- For naming conventions, const variable names must be in uppercase with _ in between for multi word.
